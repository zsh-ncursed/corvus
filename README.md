# Corvus

**Corvus** is a fast, extensible, and cross-platform terminal file manager built with Rust. It features a three-column interface inspired by modern file managers, designed for efficiency and keyboard-driven navigation.

## Features

*   **Three-Column Layout:**
    *   **Left Pane:** Quick access to XDG user folders, bookmarks, and mounted devices.
    *   **Middle Pane:** Main file list with support for sorting and filtering.
    *   **Right Pane:** Asynchronous preview for text files.
*   **Asynchronous Previews:** Previews for images (PNG, JPEG, etc.) and PDF documents are rendered asynchronously.
    *   **Progressive Rendering:** A low-resolution thumbnail is shown almost instantly, which is then replaced by the full-resolution version.
    *   **Backend Support:** Currently supports the Kitty graphics protocol.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** File operations (copy, move, delete) are handled in the background, keeping the UI responsive.
*   **Tabbed Interface:** Manage multiple directories with tabs.
*   **Search Functionality:** Search files by name or content with real-time filtering.
*   **Session Persistence:** Automatically saves and restores session state between application launches.
*   **Extensible:** A plugin system (work in progress) allows for new functionality to be added.
*   **Configurable:** Keybindings and themes can be customized via a `config.toml` file.

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

*   Rust toolchain (https://rustup.rs/)

### Building

To build the project, clone the repository and run:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be located at `target/release/corvus`.

### Running

To run the file manager directly, use:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Keybindings

### Global
*   `q`: Quit the application
*   `Ctrl+n`: New tab
*   `Ctrl+w`: Close current tab
*   `Ctrl+Tab`: Next tab
*   `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`: Previous tab
*   `Ctrl+\``: Toggle terminal view in footer

### Navigation (Middle Pane)
*   `j` / `Arrow Down`: Move cursor down
*   `k` / `Arrow Up`: Move cursor up
*   `h` / `Arrow Left`: Navigate to parent directory
*   `l` / `Arrow Right` / `Enter`: Enter selected directory

### File Operations
*   `y`: Yank (copy) selected file/directory to clipboard
*   `x`: Cut selected file/directory to clipboard
*   `d`: Delete selected file/directory (with confirmation)
*   `p`: Paste from clipboard (creates a copy/move task)
*   `m`: Bookmark the current directory
*   `/`: Activate search dialog

### Search Operations
*   `Type characters`: Enter search query
*   `Backspace`: Remove last character from search query
*   `Enter`: Select highlighted search result
*   `Esc`: Cancel search and close dialog
*   `Arrow Up/Down`: Navigate through search results

## Configuration

A configuration file can be created at `~/.config/corvus/config.toml`.

Example `config.toml`:

```toml
# Bookmarks are stored as a map of name to path
[bookmarks]
dotfiles = "~/.dotfiles"
projects = "~/dev/projects"

# Preview settings
[preview]
# Backend for image previews. "Kitty" is currently supported.
backend = "Kitty"
# Whether to use progressive rendering (low-res placeholder -> high-res final).
progressive = true
# Maximum resolution for rendered previews.
resolution = { width = 800, height = 600 }
```
